The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2013 annual report for this blog.

[![](http://www.wordpress.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/annual-reports/img/2012-emailteaser.png)](http://tasafo.wordpress.com/2013/annual-report/)

Here's an excerpt:


> The concert hall at the Sydney Opera House holds 2,700 people. This blog was viewed about **12,000** times in 2013. If it were a concert at Sydney Opera House, it would take about 4 sold-out performances for that many people to see it.
